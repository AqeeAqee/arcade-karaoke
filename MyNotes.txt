TODO:

    SongEditor:
    *  new sequencer, accept a new song class:
        * new song class
            * in which multi song as sections
            * startTick of section, for move/pan
            * sections edit: repeat/instrument/harmony/append/insert/reduceBeats/...
            * assgin notesTrack and lyric for each section
            * output to regular song
            * notes edit: remove/insert
            * print/display structure of sections
        * new sequencer
            * play/pause as build-in sequencer
            * pitch tune, pitch harmony, instrument harmony
            * jump by section, get current section
            * get notes by time/tick span, for Karaoke render
    *  deal with diff tickPerBeat when operating songs.
    *  [√] merge tracks pairwise by order, 1 to 1 conrespondence, in both tracks(filter by track ID) list of songs
           solution of: 
            * notesTrack need seperate tracks, but addHarmony will duplicate track
            * append, multi track with same ID joined mismatch (addHarmony add new track with same ID)
    *  [√] bug, bad apple lyric losted after changed pitch. bc A new notesTrack was set 
    *  [√]remove clone in addHarmony(), duplicated with addTracks
    *  [√]add SongEditor.insert()
    *  [√]add help
    *　[√]← → +pausing: adjust changeNoteWidth(ppt)
    *  [x] getNote(i, track.instrument.octave)
    *  [√]multi track with same ID: 
    *      seq worked, but buildin editor keep only first track with same ID
    Karaoke:
    *  [√]sound started a little later than note cross the current tick Line
    *      pading[√]1 when draw padding line, but why?
    *  [√]renew sequencer song by set seq.song property
    *  [√]encapsul SongEditor methods into Helper class
    *  [√]"    " as LyricSentencesSeparator
    *  [√]7/8 beats sopport
    *  [√]split sentences from lyric
    *  [√]adjust pitch at running
    *  [√]Show countdown at beginning
    *  [√]Show song title at beginning
    *  [√]shiftSentence
